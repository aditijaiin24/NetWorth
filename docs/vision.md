# Project Vision & Scope Control

### Accounting vs. Budgeting
- **Accounting** tracks the flow of every cent (The Truth).
- **Budgeting** tracks the spending plan for disposable income (The Goal).

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)
To ensure a successful delivery, the following are EXCLUDED from the initial version:
1. **Automated Bank Sync:** Users will input transactions manually or via CSV upload.
2. **Real-time Market Data:** Investment values (Stocks/Mutual Funds) will be updated manually by the user.
3. **Multi-Currency:** The app will initially support a single currency (EUR).
