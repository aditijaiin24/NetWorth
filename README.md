## Why this exists
Most "expense trackers" treat investments (like Mutual Funds) as expenses. This leads to an inaccurate view of Net Worth. This app treats assets, liabilities, and expenses correctly according to accounting principles.

## Core Features (MVP)
* **Accounting:** Double-entry ledger tracking Assets, Expenses, and Revenue.
* **Budgeting:** Category-based spending limits (The "Envelope" method).
* **Reporting:** Automated Net Worth calculation and Income vs. Expense summaries.

## Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) - *Planned*
* **Database:** PostgreSQL - *Planned*
